# Integrated System Documentation for Federated Learning and Bias Mitigation

## Part 1: Federated Learning System (`pripre.py`)

### Overview
This script, `pripre.py`, simulates a federated learning environment where multiple clients collaboratively train a machine learning model while keeping their data localized, enhancing privacy and data security.

### Client Class

#### Attributes
- **data**: `string` - Represents the client's local data on which the model is trained.
- **model**: `string` - A simulated local model trained upon initialization.

#### Methods
- **Constructor** (`__init__(self, data)`): Initializes the client with provided data and trains a model.
- **train_model()**: Simulates training of the model on the client's local data.
- **get_model_update()**: Simulates the generation of model updates intended for transmission to the federated server.

### Server Class

#### Attributes
- **global_model**: `string` - Represents the aggregated global model that is updated through client contributions.
- **client_updates**: `list` - Stores the updates received from clients for model aggregation.

#### Methods
- **Constructor** (`__init__(self)`): Initializes the server with an initial global model.
- **receive_updates(update)**: Receives and stores updates from clients.
- **aggregate_updates()**: Simulates the aggregation of client updates to update the global model.

### Simulation Process
- Initializes clients with data.
- Each client sends updates to the server.
- Server aggregates these updates to improve the global model.

## Part 2: Bias Mitigation System (`eai.py`)

### Overview
The `eai.py` script utilizes AI Fairness 360 toolkit's Reweighing algorithm to mitigate bias in datasets, focusing on protected attributes to ensure fairness in machine learning models.

### Key Components
- **Reweighing**: An algorithm used to adjust weights in the dataset to minimize bias based on the protected attributes before model training.
- **StandardDataset**: Facilitates the conversion of traditional datasets into a format that can be utilized by fairness algorithms.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Dataset Conversion**: Convert the DataFrame into a `StandardDataset`, specifying protected attributes and favorable outcomes.
3. **Bias Mitigation**:
   - Apply the Reweighing algorithm to the dataset.
   - Adjust the dataset instance weights to achieve fairness in subsequent analyses.

### Example Usage
```python
import pandas as pd
from aif360.datasets import StandardDataset
from aif360.algorithms.preprocessing import Reweighing

df = pd.read_csv('legal_case_data.csv')
dataset = StandardDataset(df, label_name='case_outcome', favorable_classes=[1],
                          protected_attribute_names=['gender'], privileged_classes=[[1]])
reweigher = Reweighing(unprivileged_groups=[{'gender': 0}],
                       privileged_groups=[{'gender': 1}])
mitigated_dataset = reweigher.fit_transform(dataset)
